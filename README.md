# Weather vs. Traffic Accidents: A Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project explores the impact of weather conditions on the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. By analyzing real-world accident data alongside weather indicators such as precipitation and temperature, we investigate patterns that can inform better traffic policies, infrastructure decisions, and public safety alerts.

The final product is a self-contained Jupyter Notebook that performs: - Data wrangling and cleaning - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - Visualization of accident trends by weather and location - Correlation analysis between weather features and accident severity - Conclusions supported by both data and prior research

## Key Research Questions

-   How do different weather conditions affect the number and severity of traffic accidents?
-   Do winter precipitation and poor road conditions lead to more severe crashes?
-   How do accident patterns vary across urban, rural, and highway locations?
-   Can weather and crash data be combined to identify and rank high-risk areas?
-   Is it possible to use weather forecasts to predict high-risk days for traffic incidents?
